# Codecademy-Python-Files-Hacking-Fender-Project
Hi there. 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. As part of my eagerness to tell better stories, and to carry out better data analysis (and keep my career options open), I've been going through the [Codecademy Data Scientist (Machine Learning) Skill Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science) 

(I've completed the SQL part. You can view my certificate [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Legrq2X0gKU4fsR8XU_1eY_9k3Ftid8g/view?usp=drive_link)). 

This project was part of the Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part II) Module (which was part of the Data Science Foundations section â€“ it's a big course). 

It's at the end of the Python Files chapter, and is intended to test one's use of writing and reading from text, csv, and json files in Python. 

## What did you learn?

* How to read and write to text, csv, and json files
* How to loop through csv rows and push them into a dictionary (from the module, not this project)
* The fact that ASCII art is actually hard to write in a script because of white space and formatting. 

## Where can I view the code?

**[You can see my jupyter notebook solution here.](https://nbviewer.org/github/david-heasman00/Codecademy-Python-Files-Hacking-Fender-Project/blob/main/Python%20Files%20Hacking%20The%20Fender%20Project.ipynb)**

## How can I speak to you?

Want to chat about a project, or a potential opportunity? I'm happy to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/). Include a brief note in your connection request about why you're reaching out. 

Till later.
